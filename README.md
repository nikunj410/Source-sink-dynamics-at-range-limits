**Summary**

The paper investigates the role of source-sink dynamics in maintaining range limits. The central finding of the article is that, unlike traditional belief, source-sink dynamics can result in a large-scale mismatch between niche and range limit. These findings suggest simple correlative species distribution models that ignore dispersal may yield misleading predictions and inferences.
